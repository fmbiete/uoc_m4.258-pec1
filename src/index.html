        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> Roles</h2>
        <p>Dublin Castle has fulfilled a number of roles throughout its history. Originally built as a defensive
          fortification for the <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Norman</a> city of Dublin, it later evolved into an official residence, used by
          the <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a> or <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Viceroy of Ireland</a>, the representative of the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Monarch</a>. The second-in-command in the
          Dublin Castle administration, the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Secretary_for_Ireland" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Chief Secretary for Ireland</a>, also had his offices there. Over the years
          parliament and certain law courts met at the castle before moving to new purpose-built venues. It also served
          as
          the base for a military garrison and later also intelligence services.</p>

        <p>Upon the formation of the <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Free State</a> in December 1922, the castle temporarily
          assumed the role of the
          <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Courts" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Courts</a>, the legal complex badly damaged during the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Civil

        <p>It was decided in 1938 that the inauguration of the first <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">President of Ireland</a>, <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hyde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas
            Hyde</a>, would take
          place in the castle, and the complex has been host to this ceremony ever since. The castle is also used for
          hosting
          official State visits as well as more informal foreign affairs engagements, State banquets, including that for
          the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 2011, and Government policy launches. It also acts as the central base for
          Ireland's hosting of the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">European Presidency</a>, approximately every 10 years. Two dedicated conference
          facilities,
          The Hibernia Conference Centre and The Printworks were installed for the European Presidencies of 1990 and
          2013,
          and are made available for rental by the private sector too.</p>

        <p>The castle's State Apartments and their associated collection of historic materials form an
          accredited
          museum,
          and the castle complex is also home to a Garda Síochána unit and the Garda Museum, some parts of the Office of
          Public Works, some functions of the Irish Revenue Commissioners - and the Revenue Museum - and the Chester
          Beatty Library. </p>

        <p>Dublin Castle was first founded as a major defensive work by <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiler_Fitzhenry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meiler

            England</a> in 1204,<a href="#footnote-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> sometime after the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_invasion_of_Ireland" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Norman invasion of Ireland</a> in
          1169, when it
          was commanded that a castle
          be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and
          the protection of the King's treasure.<a href="#footnote-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Largely complete by 1230, the
          castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep</a>, bounded on all
          sides by tall defensive walls and protected at
          each
          corner by a circular tower. Sited to the southeast of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer
          perimeter of the city, using the River Poddle as a natural means of defence along two of its sides. The city
          wall directly abutted the castle's northeast Powder Tower, extending north and westwards around the city
          before
          rejoining the castle at its southwestern Bermingham Tower. In 1620 the English-born judge <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Gernon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Gernon</a>
          was
          greatly impressed by the wall: "a huge and mighty wall, foursquare, and of incredible thickness".<a
            href="#footnote-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> In the 17th century, the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Arran_(Ireland)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earl
            of Arran</a> described the Castle as <q>the
            worst castle in the worst situation in Christendom</q>.<a href="#footnote-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

        <p>The Poddle was diverted into the city through archways where the walls adjoined the castle, artificially
          flooding the moat of the fortress's city elevations. One of these archways and part of the wall survive buried
          underneath the 18th-century buildings, and are open for public viewing.<a
            href="#footnote-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

        <p>Through the <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Middle Ages</a> the wooden buildings within the castle square evolved and changed,
          the most significant addition being the Great Hall built of stone and timber, variously used as Parliament
          house, court
          of law and banqueting hall. The building survived until 1673, when it was damaged by fire and demolished
          shortly afterwards. The Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish counterpart to the English Star Chamber, sat in
          Dublin Castle in a room which was specially built for it about 1570. The Castle sustained severe fire damage
          in 1684.
          Extensive rebuilding transformed it from a medieval fortress to a Georgian palace. No trace of medieval
          buildings remains above ground level today, with the exception of the great Record Tower (ca. 1228-1230); it
          is the sole surviving tower of the original fortification, its battlements an early 19th-century addition.<a

        <h2><i class="fa-brands fa-fort-awesome"></i> Buildings and architecture</h2>
        <h3>State Apartments</h3>

        <p>The State Apartments, located in the southern range of buildings of the Upper Yard, contain the rooms
          formerly
          used by the Lord Lieutenant for personal accommodation and public entertaining during the Castle Season.<a
            href="#footnote-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
          Today these richly decorated rooms are used by the Irish government for official engagements including policy
          launches, hosting of State Visit ceremonial, and the inauguration of the President every seven years. The
          apartments and their collections form an accredited museum.</p>

        <p>The principal rooms of the state apartment complex include:</p>

        <h4>Saint Patrick's Hall</h4>

        <p>This is the grandest room of the state apartments, and contains one of the most important decorative
          interiors
          in Ireland. Formerly the ballroom of the Lord Lieutenant's administration, today the room is used for
          presidential inaugurations. If a President of Ireland dies in office, such as Erskine H. Childers in 1974, it
          is
          here that he or she lies in state. It is one of the oldest rooms in the castle, dating from the 1740s, though
          its decoration largely dates from c. 1790, including the most significant painted ceiling in Ireland, executed
          by <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Valdre" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincenzo Valdre</a> (c. 1742-1814). Composed of three panels, the ceiling depicts
          the coronation of King <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">George III</a>, <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saint Patrick</a> introducing Christianity to Ireland, and King <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry II</a> receiving the submission of the
          Irish
          chieftains. The state dinner hosted by the President of Ireland to welcome Queen <a class="h-term"

        <p>Following the disestablishment of the <a class="h-term"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Ireland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Church of
            Ireland</a> in 1871, the <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St._Patrick"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order of
            St. Patrick</a>, Ireland's order of chivalry, moved its ceremonial home from <a class="h-term"

            rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a> to St. Patrick's Hall. The banners and
          hatchment plates of the knights who were living at the time when most of Ireland gained a form of independence
          as the Irish Free State, in December 1922, remain in place.</p>

        <h4>Throne Room</h4>

        <p>Originally built as the Battleaxe Hall in the 1740s, it was converted to a presence chamber around 1790. The
          regal decoration dates from that time and from alterations in the 1830s. It contains a throne built for the
          visit of King <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">George IV</a> to Ireland in 1821.</p>

        <h4>State Drawing Room</h4>

        <p>Remodelled in the 1830s as the principal reception room of the Lord Lieutenant and his household, today this
          room is reserved in use for the reception of foreign dignitaries. Largely destroyed by fire in 1941, the room
          was reconstructed with minor modifications in 1964-1968 by the OPW, making use of salvaged and replicated
          furnishings and fittings.<a href="#footnote-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

        <h4>State Dining Room</h4>

        <p>Also called the Picture Gallery, and formerly known as the Supper Room, this is the oldest room in the castle
          and largely retains its original decoration, having escaped major modification and fire over the years. It
          dates
          from Lord Chesterfield's building of the State Apartments in the 1740s, and was intended for use as a supper
          room adjoining St. Patrick's Hall and as a personal dining room.<a href="#footnote-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
          Today the room is still used for dining when conferences take place in St. Patrick's Hall.</p>

        <h4>State bedrooms</h4>

        <p>These former private quarters of the Lord Lieutenant were built as five interconnecting rooms running along
          the back of the building, adjoining the spine corridor that separates them from the state drawing room.
          Completely
          rebuilt in the 1960s following a fire in 1941, the rooms maintain the original courtly sequence and today are
          used as ancillary drawing and meeting rooms to the principal apartments. The last dignitary to stay in the
          royal bedrooms was Prime Minister <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaret Thatcher</a>, who spent a night there with her husband <a
            class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Thatcher" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Denis</a> during one of the European Council meetings held in the 1980s.</p>

        <h4>State Corridor</h4>

        <p>The most architectural space of the State Apartments, this expressive, deeply modelled corridor, was
          originally built c. 1758 to the designs of the Surveyor General, Thomas Eyre. Based on the early 18th-century
          corridor of <a class="h-term" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lovett_Pearce" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Edward Lovett Pearce</a> in the former Parliament House on College Green, it
          features a marching procession of
          vaults and arches which were originally top-lit. Regrettably, an office storey was built over the skylights
          following complete reconstruction of the corridor in the 1960s as the result of a differential settlement with
          the reconstruction of the adjoining drawing room. The corridor features exact plaster casts of the original
          arch detailing, and the original doorcases and fireplaces were salvaged prior to rebuilding.</p>

        <h4>Bermingham Tower</h4>

        <p>The base of the original Bermingham Tower is one of the few remaining parts of the original castle. At the
          southwest corner of the castle, the tower has a modern upper part. It is unclear which member of the De
          Bermingham family the tower was named for; perhaps William or Walter or John or Sir Walter.<a
            href="#footnote-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

        <h4>Record Tower</h4>

        <p>The Record Tower at the southeast corner is another original part of the castle. Also known as the Wardrobe
          Tower, it originally dates from the 1220s. It was restored between 1810 and 1813 by Francis Johnston.<a
            href="#footnote-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> It hosted the Garda Museum until its 2017 relaunch in the Treasury
          Building.</p>

        <h4>Bedford Tower</h4>

        <p>Construction of Bedford Tower began in 1750, and was completed in 1761 by Thomas Eyre. The Guard House
          mirrors
          it.<a href="#footnote-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

        <h4>Powder Tower</h4>

        <p>The base of this tower can be seen in the basement of the northeast corner of the lower castle yard. It was
          also known as the Storehouse Tower and was built around 1228. Its calp<a
            href="#footnote-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
          walls were 3.7 metres thick, and the internal diameter was 6.1 metres. The base of this tower is still along
          the flow of the River Poddle.
          Surviving Viking defences remain under this section of the Castle.<a href="#footnote-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <h4>Cork Tower</h4>

        <p>This tower stood at the northwest corner of the medieval enclosure. The base remains behind the west range of
          the upper castle yard.<a href="#footnote-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

        <p>The complex houses, among other things, some offices of the Revenue Commissioners, including a Stamping
          Office
          in a 20th-century building at the end of the Castle Yard. The modern office block was designed by Frank du
          Berry, a senior OPW architect, in the late 1960s. The design was denounced by many groups, citing the
          unsympathetic nature of the four-storey block and the placement, which disrupted the rectangular layout of the
          Castle. Among the groups that objected were the Irish Georgian Society, An Taisce, and the Royal Institute of
          the Architects of Ireland. Construction began anyway in 1970.<a href="#footnote-24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>

          Some elements of the OPW are based in an old stables area, and some functions of the Garda Síochána are also

          The castle complex also hosts the Chester Beatty Library, in a purpose-constructed facility, with a café, the
          Garda Museum, in the Treasury Building, and the Revenue Museum.

          The former site of the "dark pool" on the Poddle was remodelled into a garden, with a water feature that
          commemorates fallen Gardaí, and a helipad. </p>
